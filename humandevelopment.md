#### Human development has been described by Selim Jahan (head of the UNDP program) as “development of the people (capital), for the people (translated to the lives of people) and by the people (people are not only receiving but active participants in the process).” How have we done as a humanity to fulfill this hope originally manifested through the Gettysburg address? Does data science have a role to play in advancing the human condition? What role does complexity play in advancing our understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions? In order to predict valuable solutions to some of the world's most intractable problems, will combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science & statistics with global human development be sufficient, or is a new integrated paradigm needed? What hope do we have in selecting the best future path for humanity?

As Selim Jahan states, “Development of the people, for the people and by the people”, is the enhancement of an organization's capabilities and performance, which is necessary for the growth and development of a company.  Through the Gettysburg address, we have done relatively well in fulfilling this hope, however; we don’t live in a perfect world and still have a lot to improve on in today's society.  There are two main dimensions of human development; the first focuses on directly enhancing human abilities, which consists of long and healthy lives, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.  In respect to the first dimension, we have seen poverty diminish and higher access to healthcare in the last couple of centuries.  The second feature focuses on creating conditions for human development, which incorporates participation in political and community life, environmental sustainability, human security and rights and gender equality.  Human development has also allowed access to education, which can fight poverty and improve economic success.  Ultimately, human development is allowing people to make decisions and providing them with opportunities.  As Amartya Sen states, “Development can be seen as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy”, which we have successfully done as we’ve expanded our social and political freedoms, giving people the access to basic resources and needs.  According to a Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, we have seen substantial improvements in life expectancy, access to livelihood and enhanced well-being across the world coexist with pervasive poverty, disempowerment, unconscionable inequalities, major environmental degradation and democracy and governance crisis.”  

One of the most important advancements in which data science has globally impacted society is healthcare.  In many aspects, it has advanced our knowledge on human health and has helped people make more insightful decisions.  With the help of scientific methods, algorithms, structured and unstructured data, as well as technological advancements, we now have access to virtual assistance, medical imaging and predictive analytics.  We also have further knowledge on genomics, drug discovery and disease prevention and tracking, which allow us to keep our society healthy.
