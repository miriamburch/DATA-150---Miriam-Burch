[11/16 Essay (last one): Read the ~8 minute article "The Data Science Behind Self-Driving Cars" (hat tip to Connor). In 1-2 paragraphs, write what you think (or know) are the broad implications for society from the development and adoption of self-driving vehicle technology. What are the positive aspects, the not so positive, and the important considerations (e.g., ethical)?](https://medium.com/@feiqi9047/the-data-science-behind-self-driving-cars-eb7d0579c80b)

A self-driving car is an autonomous vehicle that is able to recognize its surroundings and move safely without the help of a human driver.  The car contains a variety of sensors in order to recognize their environment (i.e., radar, sonar, GPS, odometry).  This technology has shifted the way we view transportation and will eventually change our lives as itâ€™s replacing the work of humans.  Over the past couple of years, it has had quite some competition and remains an impact on multiple industries.  Although it may seem like the ideal type of vehicle, self-driving cars come with both positive and negative aspects that one should consider.  
 
Some advantages consist of the reduction of air pollution, saving fuel, prevention of car crashes due to emotional behavior or drunk driving, traffic efficiency, better access and mode of transportation, car theft reduction and environmentally friendly (reducing emissions).  On the contrary, the cons of self-driving cars include security issues, job losses, insurance issues, low level approval of the public,  danger of hacking attacks and high purchase prices.  Other disadvantages of driverless cars are that the automobile industry could suffer and that drivers will no longer feel the need to learn how to properly drive and/or learn the rules of the road.
