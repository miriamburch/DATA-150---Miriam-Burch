# METHODOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION: COASTAL EROSION IN CATALONIA

## I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, technology has evolved rapidly. The techniques of data science, from machine learning, artificial intelligence and geotargeting to data visualization have significantly helped analyze regions most impacted by climate change. By studying the effects and patterns of the change via the use of various methodologies, scientific methods, datasets and predictive analytics models, data scientists have helped our human development process. Data scientists are continuously exploring and finding new ways to cope with climate change issues as they assimilate and compare data in order to predict future trends. With these advancements, climate change is now viewed as a more complex human development process and adaptive solutions can be developed to help solve problems by locating and pinpointing areas in which changes need to be made that will impact climate targets.

Catalonia, the northeastern most region of Spain, is an ideal part of the world to study climate change because of its diverse geography including sea, coastline, mountains, rivers, cropland, and urban and rural areas. This region has experienced temperature increases, drying climates, shortage of rainfall and sea temperature and sea level rises, especially in the summer months, all of which have been occurring at an accelerating rate in recent decades. In particular, Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, has undergone some of the worst impacts of climate change such as temperature rises, a significant decrease in precipitation and an increase in droughts, heatwaves and coastal erosions. This methodological investigation focuses on two of the most important areas of climate change within Catalonia: (i) coastal erosions in Catalonia and (ii) oceanographic and meteorological observations at a coastal station in Catalonia (sea level and sea temperatures rising).  Along with these two data methods come a great deal of economic costs.  According to the article regarding coastal erosions in catalonia, “Local interventions for coastal sustainability are collected into two groups: working with nature (reed beds at the Danube Delta, restoration of dunes at Inch, overwash enhancement at Ebro Delta) and Transient Defence Measures (TDM), such as the fuse dune system at Llobregat Delta.” (1) 

## II. DATA SCIENCE METHODS
### A. SOURCES
#### Coastal Erosion in Catalonia
In Managing Coastal Environments under Climate Change: Pathways to Adaptation, coastlines in Ireland, Spain and Romania are analyzed. The Spanish coastline is approximately 7900km long and according to the article, “50% consists of hard and soft cliffs (especially present at the Atlantic border) and about 25% consists of sandy beaches.” (1) Furthermore, the Catalan coast is around 800km long, located along the Spanish Mediterranean. The north is mostly composed of cliffs (about 280km long) and the south consists of low-lying beaches. The central region is shaped around the metropolitan area of Barcelona and includes various marinas and urban settlements. As stated in this article “urban sandy beaches are typically bounded in their backside by a seafront promenade and infrastructures like streets, roads, railways and houses.” (1) In the last years, the maintenance and development of promenades have been one of the major investments undertaken by the Spanish government, with more than 50 million euros only in Catalonia during the last two decades.” (1) A study was conducted to compare the erosion and shoreline changes of beaches from 1995-2004. It showed that “more than 70% of Catalan beaches eroded, with average rates of about −2.1 m/yr and of about −3.3 m/yr when the Ebro delta is considered. (1) The authors then compare low and high sustainability practices, describing what one should and should not do. In the low sustainability practices, local politicians and environmentalists don’t try to prevent climate change but rather jump straight to the solution as actions are taken after the impact (e.g. beach erosion). An example of this is the Maresme coastal stretch in the Central part of the Catalan coast. This area is where eroding beaches and locally accretive beaches are mostly found due to a net littoral current drift from north to south and the interruption of that drift by various marinas along the coast, resulting in narrower beaches (more erosion) the further south one travels along the Catalan coastline. This coastal area faces the most energetic wave events from the East, resulting in no sand replacement on the beach once it’s washed away because of the infrastructure (i.e., buildings, apartments, roads, railways) directly abutting the beach. To prevent further erosion, and without a comprehensive plan in place for the entire coastline, local authorities have undertaken the construction of riprap revetments to defend certain beach areas. In addition to the building of more marinas, construction behind the beach (e.g., streets, houses, buildings) has formed a barrier, causing less sand to wash down from hilly areas during heavy rainfalls to replenish beach sand and also interrupting the north-south movement of the current and sediment. One comprehensive policy solution to prevent beach erosion under these circumstances would be to limit the construction of new marinas, prevent new construction along the coastline that “breaks” the natural flow of sand from hilly areas to the shore, and also construct an ephemeral small dune of 1.5 m to prevent additional beach erosion.” (1) This dune would also serve as a sediment buffer to naturally incorporate more sand onto the beach over a period of time. Potential long-term downsides of the dune pointed out by the authors is that it will eventually collapse because of sea level rise as a response to climate change. The policy solution would also incorporate incremental interventions with regular monitoring and local community involvement. (1)

#### Oceanographic and Meteorological Observations at a Coastal Station in Catalonia

This article, Forty-five Years of Oceanographic and Meteorological Observations at a Coastal Station in the NW Mediterranean: A Ground Truth for Satellite Observations, measures the air temperature and sea surface temperature in L’Estartit (a small town on the north-eastern coast of Catalonia) over many years. Local precipitation is trending downward, meaning that it has been raining less, and sea level temperatures are trending upward, or getting warmer. In fact, for every ten years, the sea level is rising three centimeters and sea levels are expected to rise one foot every 100 years. (2)

An environmental dimension of human development is being addressed by the authors’ research as climate change is the main factor in causing erosion along the coast. The development goal that can be considered in relation to this article is the analysis of the sea-level rise and temperature increase. One solution would be to not rake the beach so often, preventing erosion from occurring.
