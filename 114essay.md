#### 11/4 Essay: We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable.

I believe that it’s important to mention the different career opportunities one can go into after obtaining a data science degree.  These two articles talk about the different jobs one can pursue with a data science degree or if one chooses to work in a field within data science.  Some of the career categories include: data scientist, business intelligence analyst, chief information officer, data warehouse analyst, database manager, data modeler, database developer, machine learning engineer, applications architect, enterprise architect, infrastructure architect, business intelligence (BI) developer and statistician.  Within the job categories, each job’s average salary is recorded as well as their requirements and what they do.  In my opinion, it's vital to learn about the different job paths for data science majors or those interested in data science/human development because it helps you manage the direction in which you’re planning on going after you finish your studies.  It’s essential to have those basic job skills and knowledge as you come out of university in order to follow that dream job you’ve always wished for.  Furthermore, developing this career plan can even make major objectives that seem too hard or too distant achievable.  Another reason for why we should discuss future job titles in class is because it’s also fundamental to know how much money you can make with a data science degree and the salary you can expect if you consider applying to one of these positions, all of which these two websites have incorporated.
